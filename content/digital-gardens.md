## What is a digital garden?
A digital garden is a collection of interlinked atomic ideas, thoughts, and bits of knowledge. For this reason, they're also sometimes called *knowledge* gardens. The bits of knowledge can be anything from annotations, quotes, definitions, summaries of ideas, thoughts on great works, and so on. The important aspect of it is that each note is self-contained and covers a single idea. This atomic-style of notes makes it easy to interlink a bunch of small ideas as well as revisit each one later to expand or refine the information.

Digital gardens differ from traditional blogs in that:
- The content is not tied to a publication date.
- Each topic is largely self contained, but is tied to other topics through contextual associations.
- Topics are inherently exploratory and never "finished." 
	- Topics are intended to be nurtured into maturity.


## Why should I create and maintain one?
One argument for creating a digital garden (opposed to a blog) is that digital gardens have a less constrained user path. There's no single or best way to explore the information. Each reader's experience is unique and created as they explore the garden.

Another benefit is that digital gardens treat information more accurately: as knowledge that fluid and intended to evolve over time with the maintainer's understanding.


## What tools can I use to create a digital garden?

No-code options:

-   **Public Roam database.** One of the easiest ways to build a digital garden is to create a public database with [Roam Research](https://nesslabs.com/roam-research). To do so, just select “public” when you create a new database. You may want to get a domain name to redirect to your database so it’s easier to share.
-   **Notion.** [Notion has finally launched bi-directional links](https://nesslabs.com/notion-backlinks), which makes it a valid option for a digital garden. Create a homepage for your digital garden, then click on “Share” at the top right of the page, and toggle on “Share with the web.” Sub-pages will also be published, along with any of their sub-pages. Again, you could use a custom domain pointing to your Notion-based digital garden.
-   **TiddlyWiki.** The grandfather of digital gardening, TiddlyWiki is an incredibly versatile tool to capture and share evergreen notes. A couple of easy-to-install add-on will let you use bi-directional links and a visual knowledge graph. [This detailed tutorial](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-tiddlywiki) explains all the steps. While this is a no-code solution, just be aware that this method involves the extra step of hosting your digital garden somewhere (typically for free on GitHub).

Custom digital gardens:

-   **Jekyll.** With a very simple learning curve and a few digital gardening templates, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a great option. You can use [Simply Jekyll](https://simply-jekyll.netlify.app/posts/introduction-to-simply-jekyll) or this [digital garden Jekyll template](https://digital-garden-jekyll-template.netlify.app/) to add bi-directional links, link previews on hover, a visual knowledge graph, and more.
-   **Eleventy.** Another option is to use [Eleventy-Garden](https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden), a starter site based on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) featuring all the tools you would expect to find in a digital garden.
-   **Gatsby.** A bit more complex, [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is a framework to build websites and apps, which is used by many digital gardeners thanks to additional plugins. [Gatsby Brain](https://github.com/aengusmcmillin/gatsby-theme-brain), [Gatsby Andy](https://github.com/aravindballa/gatsby-theme-andy), and [Gatsby Garden](https://github.com/mathieudutour/gatsby-digital-garden/) are all great places to start.

Other tools:
- [**Orbit.**](https://withorbit.com/) Orbit lets you interleave recurring prompts into your writing. When used well, these prompts can help people reliably remember what they read, understand complex topics more easily, and stay connected to ideas over time. Also see [How to write good prompts](https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/).

## What processes or routines should I use to maintain my digital garden?
There's a lot of discussion and ideas around how to best maintain the information in a digital garden, but several rules of thumb have prevailed:
1. Each note should be atomic and self contained.
2. Write each note for yourself only. Do not structure or refine it as if you were going to publish it for an audience "orphaned" ideas that don't have any connections to other existing notes.
3. Notes should interlink as much as possible. Try to avoid creating
